House Price Prediction using Linear Regression
This project aims to predict house prices using linear regression. The dataset used is the House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques dataset from Kaggle

# Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/code)

# Preprocessing the Data
Before training the model, the data needs to be preprocessed. This involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling the features. The preprocessing steps used in this project can be found in the code

# Training the Model
Once the data has been preprocessed, a linear regression model can be created using scikit-learn's LinearRegression class. The model is trained on the training data and evaluated on the testing data using metrics such as mean absolute error and mean squared error. The code used to train and evaluate the model can be found in the code

# Predicting House Prices
After the model has been trained, it can be used to predict house prices for new data. The code used to predict house prices for new data can be found in the code
